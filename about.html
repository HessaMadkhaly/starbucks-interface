    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>Since our humble beginnings until today, we have been working every day based on two fundamental principles: <br>
      sharing a distinctive coffee experience with friends and contributing to making this world a better place. <br>

        We remain committed to these core principles that we established since the opening of the first Starbucks store in 1971 until this day. <br>
        
        At that time, the company was a small coffee shop located in the Pike Place Market in Seattle. It served the finest freshly roasted whole bean coffees in the world. <br>
        The name "Starbucks" was inspired by the story of Moby Dick, which speaks of adventure in the world of the seas and reflects the ancient traditions of coffee trading across the oceans. <br>
        
        In 1981, Howard Schultz made his first visit to a Starbucks store, where he greatly enjoyed his first cup of Sumatra coffee. <br>
        He joined Starbucks a year later and is now the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Starbucks. <br>
        
        In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and fell in love with the small Italian cafés and the distinctive coffee experience in a romantic atmosphere. <br>
        He then thought of bringing the concept of these traditional Italian cafés to the United States, <br>
        to create a place for friends and families to gather after a long day's work and enjoy special moments outside their homes. 
        Howard temporarily left Starbucks to start his own business by opening Il Giornale coffeehouses. <br>
        He returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors. <br>
        
        From the beginning, Starbucks has sought to achieve excellence by providing the best coffee tasting experience in exceptional atmospheres, where it connects with its customers in a unique way. <br>
        
        Our mission is to strive to be a source of inspiration and optimism for everyone—a special person who enjoys a distinctive coffee beverage in a wonderful ambiance. <br>
        
        Today, with over 15,000 Starbucks stores in 50 countries around the world, Starbucks has become one of the largest companies specializing in coffee roasting and serving, and one of the premier retail coffee establishments in the world. <br>
         With every cup, we strive to deliver an exceptional experience in a distinctive setting.</p>
